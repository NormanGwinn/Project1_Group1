# Project Title: "Covid 19- Who will Suffer the Most?"

## The recent global pandemic on COVID 19 ignites our curiousity in doing research in this field. 

## Objectives:
### * “Which US states will be the most vulnerable in facing Corona virus cases?”
###* To obtain growth rate for cases in global, selected countries, and US 
 * Using linear and exponential plot
###* Comparing the growth rate to availability of health facility (hospital bed per 1000 person) 
 * Using heat map and bubble map
###* Find correlation between infection cases with population density 
 * Using scatter plot and linear regression 

## Results:

### Based on the number of infection cases and availability of hospital bed, we estimate that Washington and California will be the most vulnerable in facing.
