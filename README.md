# Project Title:  Corona Virus Trends

## Objectives:
### What is the growth rate?
* By country?
* Use relative days; start the day count with the first case in each country
* John Hopkins GitHub Repository
* https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19.git
### Where is the virus?
* Produce a heat map
* Google Maps API 
* Maybe just US or Texas
### Fit a curve to the growth rate, that might be used for predictive purposes
### Correlate growth rate, or deaths, with
* Doctors per population (https://www.worldbank.org/)
* Hospital beds per population (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.MED.BEDS.ZS?end=2015&start=2015&view=map)
* Population density (https://www.worldbank.org/)
