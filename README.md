# Project Title: "Covid 19- Who will Suffer the Most?"

## The recent global pandemic on COVID 19 motivated us to find out the preparedness of US health care facility in facing the outbreak.   

## Objectives:
### “Which US states will be the most vulnerable in facing Corona virus cases?”
### To obtain growth rate for cases in global, selected countries, and US 
 * Using linear and exponential plot
### Find correlation between infection cases with country population
 * Using scatter plot and linear regression 
### Comparing the growth rate to availability of health facility (hospital bed per 1000 person) 
 * Using heat map and bubble map


## Results:

### The above graph shows the exponential growth rate for cases globally.

### The above picture shows the correlation between country population and average of new cases per day.

### Based on the number of infection cases and availability of hospital bed, we estimate that Washington and California will be the most vulnerable in facing.
